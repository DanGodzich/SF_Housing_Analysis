This analysis is done in two separate Jupyter Notebooks.

from the years 2010 through 2016. Then the results are placed into graphs.
The graphs include

- Number of Housing Units by year
- Average Gross Rent
- Average Sales Price by year
- Average Sales Price by Neighborhood
- Top 10 Most Expensive Neighborhoods
- Neighborhood Map where the size of the dot is avearge sales price and the color is average gross rent
- Two parallel charts

The second Jupyter Note book, dashboard, defines the various graphs into functions.
The graphs are then placed into an interactive dashboard with tabs.
